# component.pedestal

A wrapper around a [Pedestal] web server to integrate it into a
[Component] system, merging dependencies into request context.

## Releases and Dependency Information

No published releases yet.

You will need [Leiningen].

Install locally with `lein install` and use the following dependency:

    [com.stuartsierra/component.repl "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

## Usage

This section describes how to create a Pedestal HTTP server using the
Pedestal component provided by this library.

Assuming the following namespace aliases:

```clojure
(ns example.server
  (:require
   [com.stuartsierra.component.pedestal :as component.pedestal]
   [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
   [io.pedestal.http :as http]))
```

You need to construct the Pedestal [service map].

[service map]: http://pedestal.io/reference/service-map

You **must** set up an interceptor chain in the service map. (This
library adds an interceptor, so it needs the chain defined before the
service is created.) You can use [http/default-interceptors] to get
Pedestal's default interceptor chain, and optionally add
[http/dev-interceptors] for development utilities.
See [Default Interceptors] in the Pedestal documentation for details.

[http/default-interceptors]: http://pedestal.io/api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-default-interceptors
[http/dev-interceptors]: http://pedestal.io/api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-dev-interceptors
[Default Interceptors]: http://pedestal.io/reference/default-interceptors

Your service map should also contain `::http/join? false`.

Your service map should be created in a function that takes the
Pedestal **component** (provided by this library) as an argument and
returns the service map.

Example:

```clojure
(defn my-service [pedestal-component]
  (-> {::http/host "0.0.0.0"
       ::http/port 8080
       ::http/type :jetty
       ::http/join? false
       ::http/resource-path "/public"
       ::http/routes routes}
      http/default-interceptors
      http/dev-interceptors))
```

You don't have to do anything with the Pedestal component: It's just
there in case you need access to its dependencies or configuration to
construct your service map.

Once you have a service map function, you need to construct an
instance of the Pedestal component provided by this library.

The Pedestal component is constructed with
`component.pedestal/pedestal-server`, passing in your service map
function.

For example, using the service map function defined above:

```clojure
(defn pedestal []
  (component.pedestal/pedestal-server my-service))
```

Once you have a constructor, you can add an instance of the component
to your Component system map; see the [Component] documentation for
details.


### Dependencies and Context

The purpose of this library is to connect Component's
dependency-injection mechanism with Pedestal's [context map]. This is
done using Component dependencies.

[context map]: http://pedestal.io/reference/context-map

First, find all the components that your web application will need
access to. Then declare them as **dependencies of** the Pedestal
component with `component/using` and/or `component/system-using`.
Again, see the [Component] documentation for details.

At the start of every request, the dependencies of the Pedestal
component will be **merged** into the **Pedestal context map**.

For example, if you construct the component like this:

```clojure
(defn pedestal []
  (component/using (component.pedestal/pedestal-server my-service)
    [:database :mail]))
```

Then the context map will contain the `:database` and `:mail` keys,
whose values will be the corresponding components from the Component
system map. You can use these components in Pedestal [interceptors].

[interceptors]: http://pedestal.io/reference/interceptors

Make sure your dependency keys do not clash with any keys in the
Pedestal [context map]! For example, don't name a dependency
`:request` or `:response`.


### Renaming Dependencies

As in the Component library, you are not limited to one set of names
for your components. A component can have its own **local** names for
its dependencies.

If you use the verbose map form of dependencies, then the
**component-local** keys will be used in the Pedestal context map.

As an example, if you declare your dependencies like this:

```clojure
(defn pedestal []
  (component/using (component.pedestal/pedestal-server my-service)
    {:db :database
     :m  :mail))
;;    ^   ^
;;    |   |
;;    |   \- keys in the system map
;;    |
;;    \- component-local keys: merged into Pedestal context
```

Then the Pedestal context map would have the database component at
`:db` and the mail component at `:m`.
